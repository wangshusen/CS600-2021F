**Meeting Time:**

- Monday, 3:00-5:30 PM, Gateway South 216


**Office Hours:**

- Monday, 5:30-6:30 PM, Online or Gateway South 354




**Contact the Instructor:**

- For questions regarding grading, send emails to the instructor.

- For technical questions, ask the instructor during office hours, or start a discussion in the "Discussions" module of Canvas.


**Prerequisite:**

- Familiar with either C++ or Python. 

- Know the basics of C++.

- Familiar with basic data structures and algorithms, including

    * asymptotic notations (big-O, small-o, Ω, Θ),
    
    * basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues).

- If you do not meet the prerequisites, consider taking CS385 or CS590 first.

Grading Policy
---------
**Grades**:

- **A**: 93 and above.

- **A-**: [90, 93)

- **B+**: [87, 90)

- **B**: [83, 87)

- **B-**: [80, 83)

- **C+**: [77, 80)

- **C**: [73, 77)

- **Fail**: below 73


**Weights**:

- Homework 50\%

- Quizzes 30\% 

- Final 20\% 

- Bonus 2\%


**Late penalty**:

- Late submissions for whatever reason will be punished. 2\% of the score of an assignment/project will be deducted per day. For example, if an assignment is submitted 15 days and 1 minute later than the deadline (counted as 16 days) and it gets a grade of 95\%, then the score after the deduction will be: 95\% - 2*16\% = 63\%.

- Dec 10 is the firm deadline for all the assignments. Submissions later than the firm deadline will not be graded.
